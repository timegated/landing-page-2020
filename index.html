                    I got into web development at the tender age of 29 and have been pursuing the ability to create websites that stand out ever since.
                    I grew around the web and web technologies, my mom was a sql database developer and web master at the forefront of the industry back in the late nineties and into the two-thousands.
                    During that time I developed a basic udenrstanding of how the internet worked via servers, file transfers, and download speeds.
                    I remember early sites like newgrounds.com, neopets, and other browser games that kept me glued to the screen for hours. I didn't really start to ask how people created these things until late into my twenties and eventually
                    took a deep dive into web-development learning everything I possibly could about the process from front to back. Currently building simple websites and applications (some with a fair amount of complexity) with html, css, javascript
                    , and reactjs. For backend projects and parts of projects I generally use nodejs and the express framework.
